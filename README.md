# Crop Recommendation and Forecasting System for Maharashtra

This project presents a smart, data-driven **Crop Recommendation System (CRS)** tailored for the agricultural landscape of **Maharashtra**, India. 
Utilizing 22 years of climatic and agricultural data (2001â€“2022) from the **India Meteorological Department (IMD)**, the system leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques to recommend optimal crops per division and provide weather-aligned planning for farmers.
